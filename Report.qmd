# Introduction
This report aims to present an exploratory data analysis of the World Bank data for the "World" region in 2022[@worldbank2022]. We will focus on three key indicators - "Life Expectancy, Exports as a Share of GDP, and Education Expenditure as a Share of GDP" - and include visualizations and statistical summaries.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

# Data Loading
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")
df.head()
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis for Three Factors 

## Data Overview
Table @ref(tab:summary-table) provides a summary of key economic indicators used in this analysis.

```{python}
df.info()
df.describe()
```

## Checking for Missing Values
```{python}
df.isnull().sum()
```

## Factor 1: Life Expectancy
```{python}
df["life_expectancy"].describe()
```

## Factor 2: Exports as a Share of GDP
```{python}
df["exports_gdp_share"].describe()
```

## Factor 3: Education Expenditure as a Share of GDP
```{python}
df["education_expenditure_gdp_share"].describe()
```

# Visualizations

## Distribution of Life Expectancy
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(5,3))
sns.histplot(df["life_expectancy"].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True, color="green")
plt.title("Distribution of Life Expectancy")
plt.xlabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```
: Distribution of Life Expectancy {#fig:life-expectancy}

## Findings 1:
As shown in @ref(fig:life-expectancy), most countries have a life expectancy between 60 and 80 years. There are outliers with low life expectancy, which could indicate conflicts or poor healthcare.

# Boxplot of Life Expectancy
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(5,3))
sns.boxplot(x=df['life_expectancy'], color='purple')
plt.title("Boxplot of Life Expectancy")
plt.xlabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.show()
```
: Boxplot of Life Expectancy {#fig:life-expectancy2}

## Findings 2:
As shown in @ref(fig:life-expectancy2), the boxplot confirms the presence of lower outliers in life expectancy. The median value is around 72 years, aligning with the statistical summary.

## Scatter Plot of Exports vs. Education Expenditure

Figure @ref(fig:exports-vs-education) illustrates the relationship between Exports as a Share of GDP and Education Expenditure.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(5,3))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="exports_gdp_share", y="education_expenditure_gdp_share", hue="country", palette="coolwarm", s=100, legend=False)
plt.title("Exports as a Share of GDP vs. Education Expenditure")
plt.xlabel("Exports as a Share of GDP (%)")
plt.ylabel("Education Expenditure as a Share of GDP (%)")
plt.show()
```
: Relationship between Exports as a Share of GDP and Education Expenditure {#fig:exports-vs-education}

## Findings 3:
As shown in @ref(fig:exports-vs-education), Countries with higher exports do not necessarily allocate more to education. This suggests that economic priorities vary, with some nations investing heavily in education regardless of trade levels.

# Scatter Plot of Exports vs. Life Expectancy
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(5,3))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='exports_gdp_share', y='life_expectancy', hue='country', palette='coolwarm', s=100, legend=False)
plt.title("Exports as a Share of GDP vs. Life Expectancy")
plt.xlabel("Exports as a Share of GDP (%)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.show()
```
: Relationship between Exports as a Share of GDP and Life Expectancy {#fig:exports-vs-life-expectancy}

## Findings 3:
As shown in @ref(fig:exports-vs-life-expectancy), exports as a share of GDP shows high variability, with some economies relying heavily on trade while others do not. Also, education expenditure varies widely, suggesting different government spending priorities.

# Summary Table

Table @ref(tab:summary-table) provides a statistical summary of the three key indicators.

```{python}
summary_table = df[["life_expectancy", "exports_gdp_share", "education_expenditure_gdp_share"]].describe()
summary_table
```
: Summary statistics of selected World Bank indicators {#tab:summary-table}

# Cross-Referenced Discussion

As shown in **Table @ref(tab:summary-table)**, the mean life expectancy is approximately 72 years, with a significant variation among countries. **Figure @ref(fig:exports-vs-education)** suggests that there is no strong correlation between Exports as a Share of GDP and Education Expenditure, indicating different national priorities regarding trade and education funding.

Furthermore, **Figure @ref(fig:life-expectancy)** demonstrates that life expectancy varies widely among nations, with most countries clustering between 60 and 80 years. This aligns with global health disparities highlighted in prior research [@worldbank2022; @un2021].
